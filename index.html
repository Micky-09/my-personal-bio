          <h2>About me!</h2>
          <p><strong>Hi, I'm Alhassan Sherif Mohammed.</strong> I’m an aspiring Front-End Developer, passionately navigating
            the dynamic world of web development. My journey began with a fascination for how websites come to life,
            blending creativity with technology. I’m currently diving deep into the foundational languages of the
            web—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—eager to transform concepts into interactive and visually captivating digital
            experiences.As I learn, I’m focused on mastering responsive design, ensuring that my creations look stunning
            on any device. I believe that a great user experience is at the heart of effective web design, and I’m
            dedicated to crafting interfaces that are not only beautiful but also intuitive and accessible for all
            users.Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring design principles, color theory, and typography, constantly seeking
            inspiration from the world around me. I’m excited to connect with fellow learners and experienced
            developers, sharing insights and collaborating on projects that challenge my skills and expand my
            knowledge.Join me on this exhilarating journey as I embrace the ups and downs of learning front-end
            development, with the ultimate goal of building websites that leave a lasting impression.</p>
